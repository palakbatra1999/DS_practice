What is the Sliding Window Technique?
The Sliding Window technique is a powerful method used to efficiently solve problems involving subarrays or substrings. Instead of generating all substrings (which is slow), we use two pointers (left and right) to expand and contract a window within the string dynamically.

How Does Sliding Window Help in This Problem?
We need to count substrings with exactly K distinct characters. Instead of checking all possible substrings, we use a sliding window to maintain a valid substring range efficiently.

Expand the right boundary (right pointer) to add new characters to the current window.

Shrink the left boundary (left pointer) when the window becomes invalid (i.e., has more than K distinct characters).

Count the number of valid substrings as we move the right pointer.
